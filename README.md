# hello-world
Initial readings, ideas, scripts for re-education of coding. My 'tech job' is boring and far from feeling like I work in tech. I miss the basic coding I did in high school and college, so let's play.

### Plans
1. Review basic **python** syntax
2. Learn **data ingestion** strategies
3. Play around with basic algorithms
4. Recreate *Seven Degrees of Kevin Bacon* game(?)
